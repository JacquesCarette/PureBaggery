# Clean-up Tasks
- Split up Representable:
  - ContainerDesc and its Morphisms
  - RepresentablesWeLike
  - ContainersWeLike
  - Jumble
  - Fin
  - Bag

- Split Group:
  - Action and their morphisms
  - ActionsWeLike (and ActionMorphisms here too)

# Documentation
- Lots of comments all over!

# Real To Do
- In Representable:
  - refine goal 0 into composition of smaller steps
    - group hom from (Aut (Fin l) , Aut (Fin r))
       into Aut (Fin (l +N r))
    - to get ActionHom it induces
    - paos is the *target*
    - need to involve isoAction
- In Group:
  - possible that groupHomActionMor goes in "wrong" direction!
  - induced ActionMorphism of an isoAction
     (by pre-composition?)
     

- add CyclicContDesc
- derivatives !

# Done
- Split Group
  - Group (and below) and their morphisms
- Make everything compile again (ugh)
